# CNN-seminar
Additional example of a Convolutional Neural Network with some practice questions sprinkled throughout the comments and in some markdown cells. Take this as an opportunity to assess your own knowledge in a **low-stakes** environment and to give us instructors a chance to identify and cover any gaps in knowledge. 

#### Please fork and clone this repo about 20' before the session and try to complete as many of the questions as possible. We'll be answering them in the session.
